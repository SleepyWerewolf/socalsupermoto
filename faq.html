          <h2>Supermoto Trackdays FAQ</h2>
          <h3>What is Supermoto?</h3>
          <p>Supermoto combines dirt/mx riding and road racing into one discipline. Tracks are typically 80% asphalt, 20% dirt. The bikes are based on larger 4 stroke dirt bikes and feature sticky 17" wheels and rubber, and larger brakes. If you feel comfortable on any motorcycle, you'll get the hang of supermoto pretty quick.</p>
          <h3>How much/what is included?</h3>
          <p>$239 per day, includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Track fees</li>
            <li>Supermoto bike set up for the track (on busier days we share/rotate through the bikes, don't worry, you will get all the track time you can handle!)</li>
            <li>Instruction: basic supermoto riding techniques, track prep, track etiquette.</li>
            <li>Track side photography of your session so you can show off to your friends.</li>
            <li>Tshirt or hat</li>
            <li>Booking is based on first come first served per payment received, so book early!</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>How many riders/how many bikes?</h3>
          <p>Our school instruction is "semi private." We keep the class sizes small to keep focus on the riders. We use 9 track prepped drz400sm's, and keep the class size to 9-12 riders. Bikes are shared, don't worry, you'll get all the track time you can handle! </p>
          <h3>What are the requirements?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Intermediate level riding ability, dirt or street. It's fine if you've never ridden on one or the other.</li>
            <li>Proper riding gear including: dot full-face helmet (dirt or street), boots, pants with knee armor, jacket with back protection and elbow pads, gloves. Leathers recommended, full mx gear OK.</li>
            <li>18 years old.</li>
            <li>Signed release form.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
          <p>Water, riding gear, lunch.</p>
          <h3>How long is the class?</h3>
          <p>We meet at 8:30 on weekends, 9:30 on weekdays. We ride until you're exhausted! Generally we pack up around 5pm.</p>
          <h3>What days?</h3>
          <p>See our schedule on the <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a> page. We do select Saturdays, Sundays and Wednesdays at Adams. Any day we're there, the dirt is open!</p>
          <h3>Where and when do we meet?</h3>
          <p>Adams Kart Track: Meet at 8:30am on weekends, and 9:30am on Wednesdays at the track in Riverside. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=Adams+Motorsports+Park,+24th+Street,+Riverside,+CA&sll=32.824971045377126,-117.10992511464818&sspn=0.8416458218062238,1.3812754911807374&t=m&dg=opt&hq=Adams+Motorsports+Park,+24th+Street,+Riverside,+CA&radius=15000&z=13&iwloc=A">directions</a></p>
          <h3>What is the difference between Sportbike Fundamentals and regular supermoto school?</h3>
          <p>Our supermoto school teaches the basics of proper supermoto technique, i.e. the fastest way to get around a supermoto track. The skills you learn (traction control!) will translate to whatever you usually ride and includes both asphalt and dirt instruction. Our <a href="school_sbf.html">Sportbike Fundamentals</a> class uses the lightweight and very responsive supermoto bikes to specifically teach the sportbike riding techniques, that translate directly to riding canyons or sportbike trackdays. Veteran road race instructor Stuart Smith provides instruction based on years of experience teaching at race schools/road race trackdays. Our Sportbike Fundamentals days are asphalt only.</p>
          <h3>What is your rain policy?</h3>
          <p>We check <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Weather</a> the day before. If over 50% chance of rain we postpone the trackday, under 50% chance of rain trackday is a go!</p>
          <h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
          <p>Use the <a href="school_sumo.html#buynow">buy now</a> button above, email <a href="mailto:info@socalsupermoto.com">info@socalsupermoto.com</a>, or call <a href="tel:6192246686">619-224-MOTO (6686)</a></p>
          <h3>What do I bring?</h3>
          <p>Bring some water/gatorade,food, full riding gear, and that's it!</p>
          <h3>What type of bikes do you use?</h3>
          <p>Current bikes are properly sorted and track prepped drz400sm.</p>
          <h3>What if I crash/damage the bike?</h3>
          <p>We have a two-strike policy on crashing on asphalt. If you go down twice you're done for the day (dirt don't count). If you follow our instruction ideally you won't be crashing at all! Our damage policy is a "gentleman's agreement", meaning you break it, you pay for the part. We don't worry about minor scratches and tip-overs. Generally speaking, damage, if there is any, is very minor. I'll let you know the cost of the part, and we'll run your card right there at the track and you're back riding.</p>
          <h3>What if I need to cancel?</h3>
          <p>We give a full refund with 48 hours notice. No refunds will be given with less than 48 hours notice.</p>
          <h3>What type of payments do you accept?</h3>
          <p>Cash at the track, Visa, or Mastercard.</p>
          <h2>Thanks, and see you at the track!</h2>

          <h3>What is sportbike fundamentals?</h3>
          <p>Our fundamentals program is designed for riders who have no interest in riding dirt, but want to learn the critical road-racing skills necessary to properly control their sportbike. Supermoto bikes are perfect for this due to their lighter weight, tighter turns, and lower speeds.</p>

          </ol>
          <p></p>
          <h3>How do I get my permit?</h3>
          <p>Head down to any DMV, read the <a href="http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/dl655/dl665mcycle.pdf" target="_blank">Motorcycle Handbook</a>, and take the written test. You do not need an appointment. Note if you have not recently taken the drivers written test, the DMV may ask you to take that test as well.</p>
          <p><a href="http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/dl655/dl665mcycle.pdf" target="_blank">Motorcycle Handbook</a><br>
            <a href="http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/interactive/tdrive/clm1written.htm" target="_blank">Example CA Motorcycle Test #1 </a><br>
            <a href="http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/interactive/tdrive/clm2written.htm" target="_blank">Example CA Motorcycle Test #2</a></p>
          <h3>How do I get an appointment?</h3>
          <p><strong>FIRST</strong> call the DMV at <a href="tel:18007770133">1-800-777-0133</a>, or go <a href="http://www.dmv.ca.gov" target="_blank">online</a> (right after midnight works very well), and book any <strong>Tuesday</strong> driving test appointment at the San Diego Clairemont DMV. </p>
          <h3>When is the bike available?</h3>
          <p>The DMV Test Bike is available every Tuesday at the San Diego Clairemont DMV. Just book your appt for anytime, any tuesday, clairemont dmv</p>
          <h3>What do I need?</h3>
          <p>Bring your helmet, permit and $50 cash. You don't need to bring insurance. Trust me. I'll take care of all the paperwork for you. If you don't have a helmet you can borrow mine.</p>
          <h3>Where do we meet?</h3>
          <p>I'll meet you in the motorcycle parking area at the San Diego Clairemont DMV, 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment (<a href="#directions">directions below</a>). You do not need to check in at the window first.</p>
          <h3>How much?</h3>
          <p>$50 cash covers bike delivery to the DMV, insurance on the bike, practice, and the test (in other words, everything you need to get your license). <br>
            Payment accepted: cash on site. </p>
          <h3>How much practice do I get?</h3>
          <p>I'll meet you 30 minutes  before your scheduled appointment. This is plenty of time to get comfortable on the bike. Most  only use 15 minutes of practice time due to the ease of riding the DMV Test Bike. </p>
          <h3>What if I need extra practice?</h3>
          <p>If you're a bit rusty or just need more time riding I highly recommend upgrading to the <a href="school_ltr.html">Skillspak</a>.</p>
          <h3>What type of bike is it?</h3>
          <p>A Yamaha TW200 supermoto. This bike was chosen specifically because it is the smallest freeway legal motorcycle made, is lightweight, has a tall, smooth first gear, and  a low seat height. It has been modified specifically for the test with street tires, a lower seat height, and smooth gearing. I've had 4'10&quot; riders use the bike without any issues. A scooter will cut in and out as it goes around the circle, making riding very difficult. The DMV Test Bike sails smoothly around the circle without any gas, clutch, or brake.</p>
          <h3>Will your bike qualify me for a M1 license?</h3>
          <p>Yes.</p>
          <h3>What does the test involve? </h3>
          <p>Here's a low-quality video of the DMV Test Bike in action that'll give you a good idea. The test is  easy on the right bike. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KHX-Jenp1o">VIDEO</a></p>
          <h3 id="directions">Where is the San Diego Clairemont DMV?</h3>
          <p><a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&addr=4375%20Derrick%20Dr.,%20&csz=92117&Get+Map=Get+Map" target="_blank">DMV Map</a><br>
            4375 Derrick Drive<br>
            San Diego, 92117<br>
            <a href="tel:18007770133">1-800-777-0133</a><br>
            Meeting spot: Front of DMV, motorcycle parking area.</p>
          <h3>Why the San Diego Clairemont DMV?</h3>
          <p>This DMV has by far the easiest test circle and the nicest examiners.</p>
          <h3>Are you affiliated with the DMV?</h3>
          <p>No. The Test Bike offers services so you can pass the State Exam. You'll need to call the DMV at <a href="tel:18007770133">1-800-777-0133</a> to book your appointment. If you can't get an appointment call me! </p>

          <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
          <p>The Skillspack is $239.</p>
          <h3>What is included?</h3>
          <p>On day 1 we spend three hours one on one private training on the bike, covering essential street bike control skills such as: proper clutch, gas, brake controls, cornering set up, accident avoidence, countersteering, panic stops, etc. Day 2 includes additional practice on the bike and taking the DMV test to get your M1 license. We supply the bike, insurance, and DMV test appointment.</p>
          <h3>What are the requirements?</h3>
          <p>No riding experience is required. You only need to have your California Motorcycle Permit.</p>
          <h3>How do I get my permit?</h3>
          <p>Head down to any DMV, read the <a href="http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/dl655/dl665mcycle.pdf" target="_blank">Motorcycle Handbook</a>, and take the written test. You do not need an appointment. Note if you have not recently taken the drivers written test, the DMV may ask you to take that test as well.</p>
